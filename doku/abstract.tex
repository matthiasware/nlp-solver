In this work we present NOONTIME, a lightweight solver for non-linear optimization problems with box-constraints, based on Newton's method. It has minimal dependencies and is easy to use. The implementation was tested on a suitable subset of the CUTEst problem set and is compared to the open source solver library IPopt. \\
